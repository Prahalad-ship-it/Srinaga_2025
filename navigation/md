| **OOP**                | **0.75**    | Used in some areas like **ScavengerObject**, but ignored in **Quest.js** where it was needed. |
| **Classes (OOP)**       | **0.8**     | Understand classes but **overused static methods** in **QuestSystem.js**. |
| **HTML**               | **0.8**     | UI looks great, but **empty text still renders instead of hiding itself**. |
| **Sprites**            | **0.77**     | Used **static sprites** with limited animation. The **Tux NPC** had a wave animation but no others. |
