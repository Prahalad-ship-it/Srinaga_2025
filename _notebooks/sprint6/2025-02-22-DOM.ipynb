    "- DOM (Document Object Model)\n",
    "    - DOM, also known as Document Object Model, is a programming interface that allows scripts to interact with the webpage.\n",
    "    - It is used to create, read, update, and delete content in HTML and XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are some uses of DOM\n",
    "    - DOM allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications.\n",
    "    - You can use different languages to create web apps. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Animation and Movement:\n",
    "    - Smooth Transitions: Use JavaScript and CSS to create smooth animations and movements for game characters and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collision Detection:\n",
    "    - Bounding Boxes: Use the DOM to define and check the boundaries of game objects for collision detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Storage and Retrieval:\n",
    "    - Local Storage: Store game progress, settings, and player data using local storage APIs.\n",
    "    - State Management: Save and retrieve the game state to ensure continuity and persistence.\n",
