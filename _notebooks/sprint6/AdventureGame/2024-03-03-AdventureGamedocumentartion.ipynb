    "his week, we are focusing on the development of our RPG game. Currently, I am working on implementing the Yellowstone Quest, where players will engage with park rangers to learn about the history of Yellowstone, test their knowledge through quizzes, and explore various animal species—all while navigating challenges to escape the level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this, my next priorities include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x]  Implementing a proper background for the game to enhance the visual experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x]  Developing a functional compass, which is essential for players to explore Yellowstone and successfully navigate their way out of the national park.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x]  Creating a dedicated class for the compass to ensure smooth integration, along with setting up restricted zones that players cannot access.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] Exploring potential sprite variations while maintaining Chillguy, Linux, and Tux as core elements.\n",

    "This approach will enhance gameplay mechanics, improve immersion, and refine the overall player experience.\n",

    "\n",
    "Week 22\n",
    "This week, I focused on progressing toward the end of the game. I explored new ideas, such as making the compass interactive or allowing the animals to talk and share the history of Yellowstone—something I successfully implemented.\n",
