    "# JavaScript BankAccount Class - Required Homework\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `BankAccount` class that returns an object. Inside this function, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Initialize Balance**:\n",
    "- Create a `balance` variable and initialize it to `100`, or any balance you want (representing $100).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Methods**:\n",
    "- `deposit(amount)`: Adds a specified amount to the balance.\n",
    "- `withdraw(amount)`: Deducts a specified amount from the balance, but only if there is enough balance.\n",
    "- `getBalance()`: Returns the current balance.\n",
    "- `transfer(amount, targetAccount)`: Transfers a specified amount from this account to another account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "- Only allow access to the `balance` variable through the `deposit`, `withdraw`, `getBalance`, and `transfer` methods.\n",
    "- Make sure to avoid direct access to `balance` from outside the `BankAccount` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Validation**:\n",
    "- A deposit can only add positive amounts.\n",
    "- A withdrawal can only occur if the account has enough balance.\n",
    "- Transfers should be allowed only if both accounts have sufficient balance to complete the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Testing**:\n",
    "- Create a new `BankAccount` instance with a starting balance.\n",
    "- Call each method (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `getBalance`, `transfer`) to verify functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Inheritance**:\n",
    "- Create a subclass of `BankAccount`, called `PremiumBankAccount`, which offers additional benefits like no transaction fees or higher transfer limits, or whatever you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create two BankAccount instances**:\n",
    "   - Account 1 has an initial balance of $500.\n",
    "   - Account 2 has an initial balance of $1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test the following:**\n",
    "   - Deposit $200 into Account 1.\n",
    "   - Withdraw $50 from Account 1.\n",
    "   - Transfer $100 from Account 2 to Account 1.\n",
    "   - Print the balances of both accounts.\n",

    "Make sure to implement the `transfer` method so that it checks if both accounts have enough balance before transferring money.\n",

    "Create a `Car` class that models a car with a few basic properties and methods. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Initialize Properties**:\n",
    "- Create properties for `make`, `model`, and `fuelLevel` (a number between 0 and 100 representing the amount of fuel in the car).\n",
    "  \n",
    "### 2. **Methods**:\n",
    "- `drive(distance)`: Decreases the `fuelLevel` by a certain percentage based on the distance traveled.\n",
    "- `refuel(amount)`: Increases the `fuelLevel` by a specified amount, but make sure that it does not exceed 100 (the max fuel capacity).\n",
    "- `getFuelLevel()`: Returns the current `fuelLevel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "- Keep the `fuelLevel` private, and only allow it to be modified or read via the `drive`, `refuel`, and `getFuelLevel` methods.\n",
    "- Do not allow direct access to `fuelLevel` from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Validation**:\n",
    "- Ensure that when refueling, the `fuelLevel` does not exceed 100.\n",
    "- When driving, ensure that the car does not drive without enough fuel (so if fuel is 0, they cant drive).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Testing**:\n",
    "- Create a `Car` instance with an initial fuel level.\n",
    "- Test the following:\n",
    "  - Drive the car and check how the fuel level changes.\n",
    "  - Refuel the car and check that the fuel level increases without exceeding 100.\n",
    "  - Try driving the car when the fuel level is 0 and ensure that it cannot drive.\n",
