/**
 * GameEnv is a static class that manages the game environment.
 * 
 * The focus of the file is the canvas management and the calculation of the game area dimensions. 
 * All calculations are based on the window size, header, and footer.
 * 
 * This code uses a classic Java static class pattern, which is nice for managing centralized data.
 * 
 * The static class pattern ensures that there is only one instance of the game environment,
 * providing a single point of reference for all game objects. This approach helps maintain
 * consistency and simplifies the management of shared resources like the canvas and its dimensions.
 * 
 * @class GameEnv
 * @property {Array} gameObjects - An array of game objects for the current level.
 * @property {Object} canvas - The canvas element.
 * @property {Object} ctx - The 2D rendering context of the canvas.
 * @property {number} innerWidth - The inner width of the game area.
 * @property {number} innerHeight - The inner height of the game area.
 * @property {number} top - The top offset of the game area.
 * @property {number} bottom - The bottom offset of the game area.
 * @property {boolean} timerActive - Flag to indicate if the timer is active.
 * @property {number} timerInterval - The interval for the timer.
 * @property {number} time - The current time.
 * @property {number} totalQuestions - The total number of quiz questions.
 * @property {number} questionsAnswered - The number of quiz questions answered correctly.
